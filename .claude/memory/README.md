# Agent Memory

Simple scratchpads where agents record implementation details, learnings, and project context across sessions.

## Files

- `memory-orchestrator.md` - Ezio
- `memory-solution-architect.md` - Sage
- `memory-ai-engineer.md` - Kai
- `memory-frontend-engineer.md` - Iris
- `memory-devops-engineer.md` - Devo
- `memory-qa-tester.md` - Vera

## Usage

Agents update their file when they:
- Discover project patterns (file structures, naming, conventions)
- Make key decisions (architecture, tech choices)
- Learn about configurations (GCP project, deployment)
- Note important gotchas or lessons

Keep it simple. Use bullets. Include specifics (paths, commands, IDs).

Never commit secrets.
