## Active Protocols (Read Every Session)

### Skills-First Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Before ANY infrastructure or deployment work:
1. Identify technology/domain (Terraform, Cloud Run, GCS, CI/CD, etc.)
2. Check `.claude/skills/[technology]-patterns.md`
3. Search for relevant pattern (2 minutes)
4. Use documented pattern if found, OR investigate + document after verification

**Full protocol**: See CLAUDE.md

## Project Config
- **Project**: [Project Name]
- **GCP Project**: [To be configured]
- **Region**: europe-west1 (ALWAYS use Europe regions)
- **Stack**: [To be configured - likely GCP, Cloud Run, Terraform]
- **Repository**: /home/sunny/projects/interface

## Current Status

**Phase**: Not started
- Project setup in progress
- Awaiting infrastructure requirements

## Infrastructure Architecture

[No architecture defined yet]

## Critical Files & Commands

[To be documented as project develops]

**Command Format**:
- **Command**: [Command or path]
- **Purpose**: [What it does]
- **Gotcha**: [Important note if any]

## Deployment Patterns

[No patterns established yet]

## Lessons Learned

[No lessons recorded yet - use STAR format for bugs/issues]

## Documentation Map

| Topic | Document | What It Contains |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| [Topic] | [doc-path] | [Description] |

---

**Memory Guidelines:**
- Keep entries concise with bullet points
- Record specifics (paths, commands, project IDs, regions)
- Focus on project-specific context, not general patterns (those go in skills)
- Update after significant milestones or discoveries
