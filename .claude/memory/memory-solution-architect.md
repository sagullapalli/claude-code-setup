## Active Protocols (Read Every Session)

### Skills-First Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Before ANY architectural design or technical review:
1. Identify technology/domain relevant to the task
2. Check `.claude/skills/[technology]-patterns.md`
3. Search for relevant pattern (2 minutes)
4. Use documented pattern if found, OR investigate + document after verification

**Full protocol**: See CLAUDE.md

**Memory Guidelines:**
- Keep entries concise with bullet points
- Record specifics (paths, commands, project IDs, regions)
- Focus on project-specific context, not general patterns (those go in skills)
- Update after significant milestones or discoveries
